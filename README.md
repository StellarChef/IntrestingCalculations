           WORK IN PROGRESS


==================== Project Description ====================

This project began as a simple calculator assignment for my
university studies. Over time, it has evolved into a personal
exploration of object-oriented programming concepts. The current
implementation handles complex numbers with basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division.

My goal is to extend this simple calculator with more advanced
features and programming techniques, experimenting with design
patterns, clean architecture, and possibly even integrating
artificial intelligence or other innovative functionalities.
